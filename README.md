To make code adjustments, I changed the names of some variables that were not very “self-explanatory” to slightly more “complete” names with more details about their functionality.

I also noticed that the code did not handle some errors in API calls and changed them so that this was included.

Some functions were nested, so they were moved out of components to better reuse the code.

In addition to reviewing the code for small improvements in accordance with good practices, I also made visual changes to the UI. I highlighted the Team Lead card a little more and sorted the cards alphabetically (by name).

I also took care of responsiveness, even though it is a screen with few elements.

I included the search field by name at the top of the page, as requested, and included tests for this new component. I also included some tests in other components to validate some more functionalities.

If you have any questions, I am at your disposal.

(I'm not really good with readme files hehehe so I justa wanted to explain part of what was done here)
